The A6M Zero was the primary Japanese naval fighter and the most powerful fighter in the world until 1943, when the F6F Hellcat fighter joined service with the US Navy. From there the Zero suffered heavy losses, especially when the Vought F4U Corsair was put into US Navy service. The Hellcat and Corsair worked side by side, defeating the Zero and pushing into the Japanese home islands.
