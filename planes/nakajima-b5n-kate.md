The Nakajima B5N (codenamed 'Kate' by the Allies) was designed in 1935 when to be a carrier-based attack bomber. However, its limited defensive armament meant that it could only be operated with a fighter escort. The B5N spearheaded the attack in Pearl Harbor and could carry torpedoes or bombs. It was replaced by the Nakajima B6N Tenzan 'Jill'.
