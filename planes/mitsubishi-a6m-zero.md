The A6M Zero was the primary Japanese naval fighter and the most powerful fighter in the world until 1943, when the Grumman F6F Hellcat joined the US Navy. The Hellcat and the later Vought F4U Corsair could shoot down the Zero with ease, as shown in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, when 645 Japanese aircraft were shot down for the loss of 123 American ones.
