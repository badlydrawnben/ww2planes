The Val dive bomber was the primary Japanese dive bomber of the Imperial Navy. Designed to supersede the D1A, it became far better known than its predecessor. Of low-wing monoplane configuration, the prototype had elliptical wings similar to those of the Heinkel He 70, a conventional tail unit, and a circular-section fuselage; construction was basically all-metal. These planes helped in the attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and sunk British aircraft carrier HMS Hermes.
