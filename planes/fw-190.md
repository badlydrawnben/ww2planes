The Fw 190 fighter-bombers were Germany's primary fighter, alongside the Messerchmitt Bf 109. Most German fighter pilots thought it better than the Messerchmitt Bf 109. It flew into battle in 1941, and at once alarmed Allied pilots. The new German fighter had guns in both nose and wings, and was big enough to carry bombs as well. Extra under-wing fuel tanks gave it an impressive flying range of 800 km (500 miles)
