The Savoia-Marchetti S.M.81  Pipstrello was a development of the Savoia-Marchetti S.M.73      passenger airliner which had first flown in prototype form on 4 June 1934. Like the airliner from which it was derived, the S.M.81 was a three-engine cantilever low-wing monoplane with fixed tailwheel landing gear. First flown in early 1935, it was available in some numbers by the time that Italy invaded Abyssinia (Ethiopia) on 3 October 1935. Here, in addition to its dedicated bomber role, it was used also for reconnaissance and transport roles. The next operational use of the type came during the Spanish Civil War, S.M.81s were among the first aircraft provided in support of General Franco, and others served in Spain a little later as components of the Aviazione Legionaria.
