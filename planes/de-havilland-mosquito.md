The De Havilland Mosquito was used by the Royal Air Force and Royal Australian Air Force  for all kinds of different duties, from escorts to night-fighters. Mahmoud sorties were done when radar-equipped Mosquitoes attempted to lure enemy fighters into thinking they were heavy bombers and attacking.
