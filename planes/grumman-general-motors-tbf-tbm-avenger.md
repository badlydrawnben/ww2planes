In an attempt to get the same type of plane as the dreaded Nakajima B5N Kate torpedo bomber, and replace the existing Douglas TBD Devastator, Grumman designed the TBF Avenger torpedo bomber. Six flew in the Battle of Midway (4th June 1942) and, soon after, the Devastator was withdrawn from US Navy service and the Avenger was ordered. General Motors made the same planes, only these were designated TBM instead of TBF. The TBF-3s stayed in service long after VJ-Day and the end of World War Two.
