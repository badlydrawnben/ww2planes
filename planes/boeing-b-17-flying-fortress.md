The B-17 Flying Fortress was one of the best bombers of World War Two. One of the US's most famous bomber planes, it first flew in 1935 under the name of Boeing Model 299. By 1945 it was celebrated as the B-17 Flying Fortress. More than 12,000 B-17s were built to fly high in the skies above Europe or the Pacific and drop their bombs.
